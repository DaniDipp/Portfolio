# Portfolio
Private portfolio to catalog and display my personal programming projects.
I used this to try out Vue.js for the first time and to experiment with GitHub Actions for automatic deployments.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
Vue cli commands:
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
